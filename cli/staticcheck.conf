# Disable style checks that conflict with project conventions:
# - ST1005: Allow capitalized error strings for proper product names (Django, FastAPI, etc.)
# - ST1000: Package comments not required for all internal packages
# - ST1003: Allow packageJson naming (common convention for JSON-related variables)
# - ST1021: Flexible comment formatting for exported types
